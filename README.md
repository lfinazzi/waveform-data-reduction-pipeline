# waveform-data-reduction-pipeline
Pipeline software to reduce size of data acquired with picoscope 2406B for posterior analysis. This software was designed to go from 6 TB of waveform data acquired in coincidence to 600 GB of important waveform parameters for data analysis in a quantum optics experiment.
